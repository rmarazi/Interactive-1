<h1>Miss Jackson</h1>
Climbing out the back door didn't leave a mark <br>
No one knows it's you Miss Jackson <br>
Found another Victim <br>
But no one's gona find <em>Miss Jackson</em> <br> 
Jackson <br>
Jackson<br>

<div style="background-color:blue; color:white; font-family:Helvetica">
You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now <br>
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out <br>
But we're so lucky, <br>
Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down <br>
Looking for the time of your life <br>
</div>

<div style="color:red; font-family:Impact">
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud, <br>
A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown, <br>
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown <br>
The party isn't over tonight <br>

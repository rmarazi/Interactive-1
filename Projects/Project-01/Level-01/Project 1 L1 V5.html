Miss Jackson

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Climbing out the back door didn't leave a mark
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one knows it's you Miss Jackson 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found another Victim 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But no one's gona find Miss Jackson 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jackson 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jackson
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But we're so lucky, 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking for the time of your life
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud, 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown, 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But back away from the water, babe, you might drown 
<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The party isn't over tonight

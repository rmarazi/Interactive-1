<h1>
Miss Jackson
</h1>

<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Climbing out the back door didn't leave a mark</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one knows it's you Miss Jackson </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found another Victim </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But no one's gona find Miss Jackson </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jackson </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jackson</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But we're so lucky, </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Looking for the time of your life </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud, </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown, </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  But back away from the water, babe, you might drown </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The party isn't over tonight </p>

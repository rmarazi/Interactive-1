		<ul> <ol> <li>Climbing out the back door didn't leave a mark </li>
		No one knows it's you Miss Jackson <br>
		Found another Victim <br>
		But no one's gona find Miss Jackson <br>
		Jackson <br>
		Jackson </em> <br>
		<strong> <em> <li> You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now </li>
		You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out <br>
		But we're so lucky, <br>
		Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down <br>
		Looking for the time of your life<br>
		<li> A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud, </li>
		A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown, <br>
		But back away from the water, babe, you might drown <br>
	The party isn't over tonight  </em> </ul>

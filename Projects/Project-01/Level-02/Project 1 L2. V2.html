<h1>Miss Jackson</h1>
<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Climbing out the back door didn't leave a mark <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one knows it's you Miss Jackson <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found another Victim <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But no one's gona find <em>Miss Jackson</em> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out </strong><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>But we're so lucky,</em> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking for the time of your life <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But back away from the water, babe, you might drown <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The party isn't over tonight <br>
